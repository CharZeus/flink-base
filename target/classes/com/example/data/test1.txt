    Once upon a time . there was a young farmer . On a hot summer day , he was working on his farm where the soil had been shined dry . It made the farmer feel hard to plant . Suddenly , he saw a rabbit which was running fast bump into a big tree . Then the rabbit died . The young farmer picked it up happily and thought . ' I'm lucky today . It costs me nothing to gain this fat rabbit . So I can eat meat this evening . I would rather be lucky like this than work on the farm without any harvest . '
